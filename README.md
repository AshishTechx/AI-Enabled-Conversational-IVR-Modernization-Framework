# AI-Enabled-Conversational-IVR-Modernization-Framework

# IVR Middleware / API Layer Integration

## 🎯 Objective
Build a **middleware/API layer** to connect **legacy IVRs** (VoiceXML-based) with the **Conversational AI stack (ACS/BAP)**.  
The goal is to enable seamless, real-time communication between traditional IVR platforms and modern conversational AI systems.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
Legacy IVRs operate using **VoiceXML (VXML)** standards, which are not natively compatible with modern AI-driven conversational frameworks like **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** or **Bot Application Platform (BAP)**.  
This middleware layer bridges that gap, acting as a **translation and communication interface** between these two worlds.

## 🛠️ Key Tasks

### 1. Design and Implement Connectors / APIs
- Develop **connectors or APIs** to facilitate communication between:
  - **VXML-based IVR systems** (e.g., Cisco CVP, Avaya Experience Portal)
  - **ACS/BAP Conversational AI platforms**
- Define communication standards and message structures (JSON/XML).
- Support both **synchronous (REST)** and **asynchronous (WebSocket/Event)** communication methods.
- Implement request/response handlers for:
  - Session management  
  - Prompt delivery and response collection  
  - Context transfer and metadata handling  

---

### 2. Ensure Real-Time Data Handling and System Compatibility
- Build a **real-time data exchange layer** with low-latency API calls (< 500ms target).  
- Ensure compatibility with:
  - VXML protocols and grammars  
  - ACS/BAP AI request and response formats  
  - Legacy IVR call control systems  
- Integrate with **message queues** or **event buses** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus) for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Include **retry**, **timeout**, and **fallback** mechanisms to maintain continuity under network or system failures.

---

### 3. Validate Integration Layer with Sample Transactions and Flow Testing
- Create **sample IVR call flows** to validate:
  - End-to-end connectivity between VXML → Middleware → AI stack.  
  - Real-time interaction and event propagation.  
- Perform **transactional testing** with mock ACS/BAP responses.
- Verify:
  - Latency and performance metrics  
  - Session continuity and context preservation  
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
